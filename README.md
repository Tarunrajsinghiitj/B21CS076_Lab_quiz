Answer14:

Answer15: In XV6 Paging works in a similar fashion of dividing the physical memory into blocks called pages 
            and dividing the Virtual memory into blocks called frames and then these pages are allocated to different frames by keeping a record into a page table.
         Paging is a memory management and space allocation scheme where non-contagious memory allocation 
          for pages of a process is done by maintaining a page table which helps to translate logical address to physical address during address translation. 
          This concept of paging helps us to accomodate multiple programs on the Main memory and also  enhance the working of multiple processes simultaneously.

Answer16: Three essential shell commands in the XV6 operating system that I have used are:
            1: ls --> used to list the contents of the current directory
            2: cd --> change directory command to go to another directory
            3: echo --> Prints the given text to the output console terminal
