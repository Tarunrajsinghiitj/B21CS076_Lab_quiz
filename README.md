Answer1: - b. A Unix-like operating system

Answer2: - b. Linux

Answer3: - d. simple

Answer4: - b. As interrupts

Answer5: - a. 128
Interrupts are essential in xv6's to multitask and react to external events.
      Control is transferred to the kernel via hardware interrupts, which are enabled by I/O operations.
      By handling the interrupt, the kernel's interrupt handler enables the operating system to respond to asynchronous events.
      Software interrupts, often known as system calls, give user programs a regulated way to ask the kernel for services.
      Saving the current state, running the interrupt handler, and then restoring the state are the steps involved in handling interrupts.
      In xv6, interrupts are essential for responsiveness because they let the system deal with outside events quickly and divide the CPU among several activities effectively.

Answer12:   Unused: Initial state of the process
            Embryo: The process is under the operation of being created but is not yet ready to run.
            Sleeping: The process is waiting for some event to occur like I/O or some other event.
            Runnable: The process have all conditions fulfiled to run but not yet running.
            Running: The process is currently running on the CPU.
            Zombie: The process has terminated, but its exit status is required by its parent to consider it      
            completed and then remove it.

Answer13: Superblock: Holds important file system metadata, including the overall count of blocks and inodes.
         Inode: Pointers to data blocks, size information, and permissions are all stored in the inode, which is a representation of a file or directory.
         Data blocks: The actual space used to store directory entries or file content.
         Directory entry: A directory entry associates readable file names with the appropriate inodes.
         Bitmaps: Show which data blocks and inodes are in use by tracking their allocation status.
         File descriptor table: Keeps track of a process's open files, including the offset of the active file.
         Log:  After a crash, it offers a means of restoring the file system to a consistent condition.
         Cylinder groups:  To maximize efficiency and parallelism in file system operations, group disk space into manageable chunks.


Answer14: System calls provide a interface for user programs to request services from the kernel in xv6.
            Example: fork() or exit(). 
            Library functions, such as those in the C standard library, are user-level routines that applications link against, Example: printf() or malloc(). 

Answer15: In XV6 Paging works in a similar fashion of dividing the physical memory into blocks called pages 
            and dividing the Virtual memory into blocks called frames and then these pages are allocated to different frames by keeping a record into a page table.
         Paging is a memory management and space allocation scheme where non-contagious memory allocation 
          for pages of a process is done by maintaining a page table which helps to translate logical address to physical address during address translation. This concept of paging helps us to accomodate multiple programs on the Main memory and also enhance the working of multiple processes simultaneously.

Answer16: Three essential shell commands in the XV6 operating system that I have used are:
            1: ls --> used to list the contents of the current directory
            2: cd --> change directory command to go to another directory
            3: echo --> Prints the given text to the output console terminal

Answer17: In xv6, process synchronization plays a critical role in coordinating multiple processes to prevent data corruption and 
         and also faciliates consistent execution. It keeps data consistent and avoids race Conditions. 
         To synchronize access to shared resources, xv6 uses condition variables (sleep() and wakeup()) and locks, which are implemented through procedures   like : the acquire() and release().
         Locks helps in enabling mutual exclusion so that only one process can access the critical section at a time. 

Answer18: Interrupts are essential in xv6's to multitask and react to external events.
      Control is transferred to the kernel via hardware interrupts, which are enabled by I/O operations.
      By handling the interrupt, the kernel's interrupt handler enables the operating system to respond to asynchronous events.
      Software interrupts, often known as system calls, give user programs a regulated way to ask the kernel for services.
      Saving the current state, running the interrupt handler, and then restoring the state are the steps involved in handling interrupts.
      In xv6, interrupts are essential for responsiveness because they let the system deal with outside events quickly and divide the CPU among several activities effectively.
